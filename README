To build the software:

$ make

To install it:

$ sudo make install 

This will put the executables in /usr/local/bin

To initialize or re-create the database files:

$ sudo /usr/local/bin/dbr_ctl initdb [force]

To start the db:

$ sudo /usr/local/bin/dbr_ctl start

Look at the top of the dbr_ctl script for some initialization variables you
 might want to change.

Precis
--------------
Roxanne is a very simple database server that allows a client to store and 
retrieve values by key.  Keys are stored in a hash map of 64K buckets. 
Hash collisions are resolved by separate chaining onto linked lists at the 
end of the index file. The default location for the index file is in
/var/roxanne/idx

The values for the given keys are stored in contiguous 4KB blocks in the 
database file (/var/roxanne/db).  A file called block_bitmap tracks the 
free/busy blocks in the db file. The dbr processes memory-map this file 
for very fast access. The db file starts out with zero blocks. 
Blocks are only added to the db file as needed to accomodate new records. 
As typically built, the database can accomodate about a billion blocks.
